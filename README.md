## Algorithms and Data Structure Problems Using Java, Python,JS..... 
#### a little progress every day adds up to big results!

Note: All of these problems are solved by me, some of them are already tested while studying in coursera or while participating in contests, some are just for learning and improving my Problem solving skill.


## Warm Up Problems:

## Greedy Approach: 

| Problem | Description |
| :---:   | :---: |
| [Money Change.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Greedy%20Algorithms/money%20change/Change.java) | The goal in this problem is to find the minimum number of coins needed to change the input value (an integer)into coins with denominations 1, 5, and 10. |
| [Maximum Value of the Loot.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Greedy%20Algorithms/maximum%20value%20of%20the%20loot/fractional_knapsack.java) | The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem|
| [Maximum Advertisement Revenue.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Greedy%20Algorithms/maximum%20advertisement%20revenue/DotProduct.java) |Given two sequences 𝑎1,𝑎2,...,𝑎𝑛 (𝑎𝑖 is the profit per click of the 𝑖-th ad) and 𝑏1,𝑏2,...,𝑏𝑛 (𝑏𝑖 is the average number of clicks per day of the 𝑖-th slot), we need to partition them into 𝑛 pairs (𝑎𝑖,𝑏𝑗) such that the sum of their products is maximized|

## Divide and Conquer Approach: 

| Problem | Description |
| :---:   | :---: |
| [Binary Search.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Divide%20and%20Conquer/BinarySearch/BinarySearch.java) | The goal in this code problem is to implement the binary search algorithm |
| [Majority Element.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Divide%20and%20Conquer/MajorityElement/MajorityElement.java) | Majority rule is a decision rule that selects the alternative which has a majority, that is, more than half the votes. Given a sequence of elements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, you would like to check whether it contains an element that appears more than 𝑛/2 times. A naive way to do this is the following.|
| [Number of Inversions.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Divide%20and%20Conquer/number%20of%20inversions/Inversions.java) |An inversion of a sequence 𝑎0,𝑎1,...,𝑎𝑛−1 is a pair of indices 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑗 < 𝑛 such that 𝑎𝑖 > 𝑎𝑗. The number of inversions of a sequence in some sense measures how close the sequence is to being sorted. For example, a sorted (in non-descending order) sequence contains no inversions at all, while in a sequence sorted in de- scending order any two elements constitute an inversion (for a total of 𝑛(𝑛 − 1)/2 inversions).|

## Dynamic programming : 

| Problem | Description |
| :---:   | :---: |
| [Longest Common Subsequence of Two Sequences.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Dynamic%20programming/Longest%20common%20subsequence%20of%20two%20sequences/LCS2.java) |Given two sequences 𝐴 = (𝑎1,𝑎2,...,𝑎𝑛) and 𝐵 = (𝑏1,𝑏2,...,𝑏𝑚), find the length of their longest common subsequence, i.e., the largest non-negative integer 𝑝 such that there exist indices 1 ≤ 𝑖1 < 𝑖2 <···<𝑖𝑝 ≤𝑛and1≤𝑗1 <𝑗2 <···<𝑗𝑝 ≤𝑚,suchthat𝑎𝑖1 =𝑏𝑗1,...,𝑎𝑖𝑝 =𝑏𝑗𝑝.|
| [Money Change.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Dynamic%20programming/Money%20Change/ChangeDP.java) |As we already know, a natural greedy strategy for the change problem does not work correctly for any set of denominations. For example, if the available denominations are 1, 3, and 4, the greedy algorithm will change 6 cents using three coins (4 + 1 + 1) while it can be changed using just two coins (3 + 3).The goal now is to apply dynamic programming for solving the Money Change Problem for denominations 1, 3, and 4.|
| [Primitive Calculator.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Dynamic%20programming/Primitive%20Calculator/PrimitiveCalculator.java) | Given an integer 𝑛, compute the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number 𝑛 starting from the number 1|
| [Maximum Amount of Gold.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure/blob/master/Dynamic%20programming/maximum%20amount%20of%20gold/Knapsack.java) |Given 𝑛 gold bars, find the maximum weight of gold that fits into a bag of capacity 𝑊 |
| [Partitioning Souvenirs.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure/blob/master/Dynamic%20programming/partitioning%20souvenirs/Partition3.java) |You and two of your friends have just returned back home after visiting various countries. Now you would like to evenly split all the souvenirs that all three of you bought.|


## Basic Data Structure :

| :---:   | :---: |
| [Check brackets in the code.py](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure/blob/master/Data%20Structure/Check%20brackets/check_brackets.py)| In this problem you will implement a feature for a text editor to find errors in the usage of brackets in the code. |
| [Extending stack interface.py](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure/blob/master/Data%20Structure/stack%20with%20max/stack_with_max_naive.py)| Implement a stack supporting the operations Push(), Pop(), and Max(). |
