## Algorithms and Data Structure Problems Using Java, Python,JS..... 
#### a little progress every day adds up to big results!

Note: All of these problems are solved by me, some of them are already tested while studying in coursera or while participating in contests, some are just for learning and improving my Problem solving skill.


## Warm Up Problems: 

| Problem | Description |
| :---:   | :---: |
| [Maximum Pairwise Product.js](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Algorithmic%20Warmup/max%20pairwise%20product/max_pairwise_product.js) | Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers |
| [Greatest Common Divisor.js](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Algorithmic%20Warmup/greatest%20common%20divisor/gcd.js) | Find the Greatest Common divisor|
| [Last Digit of a Large Fibonacci Number.js](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Algorithmic%20Warmup/fibonacci_last_digit/fibonacci_last_digit.js) | find the last digit of 𝑛-th Fibonacci number|
| [Fibonacci Number.js](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Algorithmic%20Warmup/fibonacci/fibonacci.js) |implement an efficient algorithm for computing Fibonacci numbers|
| [LCM.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Algorithmic%20Warmup/LCM/LCM.java) |Find the leatest Common Mulitple|

## Greedy Approach: 

| Problem | Description |
| :---:   | :---: |
| [Money Change.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Greedy%20Algorithms/money%20change/Change.java) | The goal in this problem is to find the minimum number of coins needed to change the input value (an integer)into coins with denominations 1, 5, and 10. |
| [Maximum Value of the Loot.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Greedy%20Algorithms/maximum%20value%20of%20the%20loot/fractional_knapsack.java) | The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem|
| [Maximum Advertisement Revenue.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Greedy%20Algorithms/maximum%20advertisement%20revenue/DotProduct.java) |Given two sequences 𝑎1,𝑎2,...,𝑎𝑛 (𝑎𝑖 is the profit per click of the 𝑖-th ad) and 𝑏1,𝑏2,...,𝑏𝑛 (𝑏𝑖 is the average number of clicks per day of the 𝑖-th slot), we need to partition them into 𝑛 pairs (𝑎𝑖,𝑏𝑗) such that the sum of their products is maximized|

## Divide and Conquer Approach: 

| Problem | Description |
| :---:   | :---: |
| [Binary Search.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Divide%20and%20Conquer/BinarySearch/BinarySearch.java) | The goal in this code problem is to implement the binary search algorithm |
| [Majority Element.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Divide%20and%20Conquer/MajorityElement/MajorityElement.java) | Majority rule is a decision rule that selects the alternative which has a majority, that is, more than half the votes. Given a sequence of elements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, you would like to check whether it contains an element that appears more than 𝑛/2 times. A naive way to do this is the following.|
| [Number of Inversions.java](https://github.com/iifawzi/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure-/blob/master/Divide%20and%20Conquer/number%20of%20inversions/Inversions.java) |An inversion of a sequence 𝑎0,𝑎1,...,𝑎𝑛−1 is a pair of indices 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑗 < 𝑛 such that 𝑎𝑖 > 𝑎𝑗. The number of inversions of a sequence in some sense measures how close the sequence is to being sorted. For example, a sorted (in non-descending order) sequence contains no inversions at all, while in a sequence sorted in de- scending order any two elements constitute an inversion (for a total of 𝑛(𝑛 − 1)/2 inversions).|
